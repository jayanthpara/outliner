# Edge Detection and Enhancement with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to apply edge detection and enhancement techniques on images using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It uses Sobel filters to detect edges and then enhances them with the Canny edge detection algorithm.

## Features

- **Edge Detection**: Detect edges using Sobel filters in both x and y directions.
- **Edge Enhancement**: Apply Canny edge detector to enhance the edges.
- **Graphical Output**: Display the original image, edge-detected image, and enhanced edge-detected image using Matplotlib.
- **File Input**: Allows users to select images from their file system via a simple file dialog interface.

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
